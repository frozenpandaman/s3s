s3s ü¶ë
=====

**s3s** is a script that uploads _Splatoon 3_ battle data from the SplatNet 3 service (part of the Nintendo Switch Online app) to [stat.ink](https://stat.ink/), a site for recording, visualizing, and aggregating statistics from the *Splatoon* series of games.

Looking to track your _Splatoon 2_ gameplay? See **[splatnet2statink](https://github.com/frozenpandaman/splatnet2statink)**.

### Features
 - [x] Full automation of SplatNet token generation via user log-in
 - [x] Ability to parse & upload complete battle stats to stat.ink
 - [x] Monitoring for new battle results in real-time & checking for missing/unuploaded battles
 - [x] Support for all available game languages
 - [x] Modular design to support [IkaLog3](https://github.com/hasegaw/IkaLog3) and other tools

### What's coming?
 - [ ] Support for Splatfest battles, Salmon Run jobs & Grizzco profile data (as soon as stat.ink supports it!)
 - [ ] Monitoring mode for Salmon Run
 - [ ] Post-battle scoreboard & gear screenshots
 - [ ] Flag to black out other players' names from results
 - [ ] Downloadable, pre-packaged program executables

---

## Usage üêô
```
$ python s3s.py [-M [N]] [-r] [-nsr | -osr]
```

The `-M` flag runs the script in monitoring mode, uploading new battles/jobs as you play, checking for new results every `N` seconds; if no `N` is provided, it defaults to 300 (5 minutes).

The `-r` flag checks for & uploads any battles/jobs present on SplatNet 3 that haven't yet been uploaded.

The `-nsr` flag makes Salmon Run jobs **not** be monitored/uploaded. Use this if you're playing Lobby modes only.

The `-osr` flag, conversely, makes **only** Salmon Run jobs be monitored/uploaded. Use this if you're playing at Grizzco only.

<!-- The `--blackout` flag blacks out other players' names on scoreboard result images and in uploaded data. -->

Arguments for advanced usage (e.g. locally exporting data to JSON files) can be viewed using `--help`.

### Example usage

Running `python s3s.py -M -r` uploads all recent Turf War/Ranked battles _and_ Salmon Run jobs not already present on stat.ink, and then continues in monitoring mode, checking for new results every 5 minutes.

Running `python s3s.py -M 900 -osr` monitors for new Salmon Run results, checking every 15 minutes.

## Setup instructions üî∞

1. Download and install Python 3. On Windows, grab the latest release from [Python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/) and check the option during setup to add it to your PATH. On macOS, install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) and run `brew install python` from Terminal.

2. If you're on Windows, install [Git](https://git-scm.com/download/win) (pre-installed on macOS and Linux).

3. Download the script from the command line (macOS: Terminal; Windows: Command Prompt/PowerShell) by running `git clone https://github.com/frozenpandaman/s3s.git`.

4. Navigate to the newly-created directory (`cd s3s/`) and install the required Python libraries by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`. On Windows, you may have to use `python -m pip` instead.

5. Running the script for the first time will prompt you to enter your stat.ink API Token (available in [settings](https://stat.ink/profile)). If you're playing _Splatoon 3_ in a language other than English, you may enter your language code (locale) as well.

**NOTE: Read the "Token generation" section below before proceeding. [‚Üí](#token-generation-)**

6. You will then be asked to navigate to a specific URL on Nintendo.com, log in, and follow simple instructions to obtain your `session_token`; this will be used to generate a `gtoken` and `bulletToken`. If you are opting against automatic token generation, enter "skip" for this step, at which point you will be asked to manually input your two tokens instead (see the [mitmproxy instructions](https://github.com/frozenpandaman/s3s/wiki/mitmproxy-instructions)).

    These tokens (used to access your SplatNet battle results) along with your stat.ink API key and language will automatically be saved into `config.txt` for you. You're now ready to upload battles!

### Accessing SplatNet 3 from your browser

If you wish to access SplatNet 3 from your computer rather than via the phone app, navigate to [https://api.lp1.av5ja.srv.nintendo.net/](https://api.lp1.av5ja.srv.nintendo.net/) (it should show server maintenance). Use your browser or a third-party extension to add a cookie (Chrome instructions [here](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/storage/cookies/)) named `_gtoken`. Set it to the value you obtained previously (automatically by running the script, or via [mitmproxy](https://github.com/frozenpandaman/s3s/wiki/mitmproxy-instructions) ‚Äì stored as `gtoken` in `config.txt`) and refresh the page. If you only want to access SplatNet and don't have a stat.ink API key, simply enter "skip" for this step during setup.

To access SplatNet 3 in a language other than English, go to `https://api.lp1.av5ja.srv.nintendo.net/?lang=xx-XX` where `xx-XX` is one of the available [language codes](https://github.com/frozenpandaman/s3s/wiki/languages).

You can even enter QR codes on the web version of SplatNet 3 via the list of available ones [here](https://github.com/frozenpandaman/s3s/wiki/list-of-qr-codes)!

*Splatoon 3* stage rotation information and current SplatNet gear are viewable at [splatoon3.ink](https://splatoon3.ink/).


## Token generation ü™ô

For s3s to work, [tokens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Access_token) known as `gtoken` and `bulletToken` are required to access SplatNet. These tokens may be obtained automatically, using the script, or manually via the official Nintendo Switch Online app. Please read the following sections carefully to decide whether or not you want to use automatic token generation.

### Automatic

Automatic token generation involves making a *secure request to a non-Nintendo server with minimal, non-identifying information*. We aim to be 100% transparent about this and provide in-depth information on security and privacy. Users who feel uncomfortable with this may opt to manually acquire their tokens instead.

**Privacy statement:** No identifying information is ever sent to the [imink API](https://status.imink.app/). Usernames and passwords are far removed from where the API comes into play and are never readable by anyone but you, and returned hash values do not contain meaningful information about your account. It is not possible to use either sent or stored data to identify which account/user performed a request, to view any identifying information about a user, or to gain access to an account. See the [imink API Privacy Policy](https://github.com/JoneWang/imink/wiki/Privacy-Policy) and [Documentation](https://github.com/JoneWang/imink/wiki/imink-API-Documentation) for more information.

Alternatively, you can use [nsotokengen](https://github.com/clovervidia/nsotokengen) or [nxapi-znca-api](https://github.com/samuelthomas2774/nxapi-znca-api) as a drop-in replacement (customizable in `config.txt`) in order to generate tokens locally without calls to a third-party API.

### Manual

Users who decide against automatic token generation may instead generate/retrieve tokens manually via the SplatNet 3 service.

In this case, users must obtain tokens from their phone ‚Äì or an emulator ‚Äì by intercepting their device's web traffic and entering the tokens into s3s when prompted (or manually adding them to `config.txt` later). Follow the [mitmproxy instructions](https://github.com/frozenpandaman/s3s/wiki/mitmproxy-instructions) to obtain your tokens. To opt against automatic acquisition, type "skip" when prompted to enter the "Select this account" URL.
